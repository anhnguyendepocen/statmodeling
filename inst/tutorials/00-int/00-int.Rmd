Here are some of the things I work on:

- Party competition:
    - *The Centre-Right versus the Radical Right: the Role of Migration Issues and Economic Grievances* (with Tarik Abou-Chadi and Markus Wagner)
    - *Does Accommodation Work? Mainstream Party Strategies and the Success of Radical Right Parties* (with Werner Krause and Tarik Abou-Chadi)
    - *Getting the most out of comparative vote-switching data: A new framework for studying dynamic multiparty competition* (with Werner Krause and Tarik Abou-Chadi)
- Far-right voting:
    - *Between strategy and protest: How policy demand, political dissatisfaction and strategic incentives matter for far-right voting*
    - *Ã–konomisches Risiko und die elektorale Anziehungskraft der AfD*
    - *Economic Risk, Anti-Immigration Preferences and Voting for the Radical Right*
- The political economy of spatial inequalities:
    - *The Political Economy of Rental Housing* (with Tarik Abou-Chadi and Thomas Kurer)
    - *Regional Labor Markets and the Politics of Resentment* (with Sergi Pardos-Prado)
    - *Political Reactions to Local Housing Market Dynamics* (grant proposal)
- Methods:
    - [*Methods Bites: Blog of the MZES Social Science Data Lab*](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/) (with Cosima Meyer and Julian Bernauer)
    - *Applied Causal Inference (with R)* (with Paul C. Bauer)
    - *When (not) to trust the overlap in confidence intervals: A practical guide.*
- Software:
    - [`regplane3D`](https://github.com/denis-cohen/regplane3D): Plotting Regression Predictions in 3D
    - [`flex_bib`](https://github.com/paulcbauer/flex_bib): Flexibly generate multiple bibliographies in RMarkdown (with Paul C. Bauer)


## So, who are you?

Briefly tell me:

1. Your program, year, and main research interest/thesis title.
1. Why you chose to attend this class.
1. If you could successfully install Stan and get it to run...

## Statistical Modeling with R and Stan

### Primary Learning Objectives

1. Understand generalized linear models as a common theoretical framework for statistical models
1. Understand how to process estimates from generalized linear models into substantively meaningful quantities of interest *without* relying on pre-implemented software
1. Understand how to use distributional summaries as a flexible framework for reporting inferential uncertainty
1. *Applied* Bayesian statistics: Learn how to translate formal statistical models into code using Stan

### Secondary Learning Objectives

1. Bump up your programming skills
1. Bump up your understanding of probability theory
1. *Theoretical* Bayesian statistics: Learn about fundamentals concepts of Bayesian statistics

## Structure of our sessions

We have 120 minutes per session. We will flexibly divide each session into the following sequence:

1. Lecture
2. Hands-on exercises (breakout rooms, in teams of three)
3. Discussing solutions to exercises
4. Breaks

## Feedback

While bits and pieces of the teaching materials existed before, much of this workshop is a first. 

Feel free to share your feedback at any time, especially when you have suggestions that we can accommodate on the fly.
